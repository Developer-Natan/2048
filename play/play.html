    <h1>How to Play 2048</h1>
    <p>
      2048 is a sliding tile puzzle game where the goal is to combine numbered
      tiles to reach the number 2048. Here's how to play:
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      Combine tiles of the same number by sliding them on a 4x4 grid. Your aim
      is to create a tile with the number 2048.
    </p>

    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Arrow Keys:</strong> Use to slide tiles. Here are the controls:
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 0; justify-content: center">
          <img
            src="/image/keyboard.jpg"
            alt="Keyboard Controls"
            style="width: 200px; margin: 5px"
          />
          <br />
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>At the start, youâ€™ll see two tiles on the grid, either 2 or 4.</li>
      <li>
        Slide tiles in any direction. All tiles will move as far as possible in
        that direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with
        their values combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep merging tiles to create higher numbers, aiming for the 2048 tile.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tips">
      <h2>Tips & Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to keep your highest-value tile in one corner.</li>
        <li>
          Focus on building a chain of tiles leading to your highest number.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid sliding tiles in ways that separate large tiles.</li>
        <li>Plan your moves ahead to prevent filling up the grid.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Game Over</h2>
    <p>
      The game ends when there are no more valid moves (the grid is full and no
      tiles can merge).
    </p>

    <p>Good luck and have fun playing 2048!</p>
